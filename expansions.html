    <p>Heavensward was the first expansion that was released in FFXIV. Its story focused on the connection between Eorzeans and dragons, with the release of three classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian, and Machinist. It also saw the introduction of flying.</p>

    <!-- Stormblood Expansion -->

    <p>Stormblood brought a unique perspective on Eorzea’s politics. It focused on liberating cities from the Garlean Empire and brought more features to the game, such as swimming, Ultimate Raids, and Eureka. It also added Red Mage and Samurai jobs, as well as the unique Blue Mage job.</p>

    <!-- Shadowbringers Expansion -->

    <p>Shadowbringers is the expansion that brought FFXIV to the next level. For the first time, players were able to travel to a new world, the First, and were shown the game’s whole story from another perspective by becoming the Warrior of Darkness.</p>
    <p>It also saw the release of Dancer and Gunbreaker jobs, Alliance Raids in collaboration with NieR: Automata, a graphical update, and Viera and male Hrothgar as new playable races.</p>

    <!-- Endwalker Expansion -->

    <p>Endwalker was a unique expansion in FFXIV because it brought the narrative arc that began with A Realm Reborn to an end. It was also more ambitious than every previous expansion, with not only one new world to explore but several. It also saw the release of Reaper and Sage jobs. The latter was the first job to be released exclusively in FFXIV and not in any other FF title.</p>

    <!-- Dawntrail Expansion -->
    <h2>Dawntrail (2024)</h2>

    <p>Dawntrail will be the fifth expansion to be released in FFXIV, and it’s planned to begin a new narrative arc. It brings Square Enix’s MMO to a new era, with a significant graphical update and various quality-of-life changes, in addition to a new story and three jobs: Viper, Pictomancer, and Beastmaster.</p>
